# babel-preset-enact

> This package includes the Babel preset used by Enact.

## Usage in Enact projects created by Enact CLI

The easiest way to use this configuration is with [Enact CLI](https://github.com/enactjs/cli), which includes it by default. You donâ€™t need to install it separately in Enact projects.

## Usage Outside of Enact projects

If you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Enact CLI, you can install it with the following steps.

First, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).

Then install babel-preset-enact.

```sh
npm install babel-preset-enact --save-dev
```

Then create a file named `.babelrc` with the following contents in the root folder of your project:

```json
{
  "presets": ["babel-preset-enact"]
}
```

For more information including `.babelrc` setup, please see the [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files).
